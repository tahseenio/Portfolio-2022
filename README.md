- EmailJS, react-hook-form and yup for input validation and handling and contact form submission.
- Mantine for UI components (dark mode toggle and modal button)
- react-pdf-viewer to show resume in browser
- react-icons for icons

## Lessons Learned:
- I solidifed my knowledge in being able to create efficient reusable components in TypeScript. 
- I learned more advanced animations in Framer Motion which I am now able to use in future projects.

## Future optimizations
- Correct my types in some components as they are currently set to the 'any' type. This was due to being unable to figure out the correct type when using certain hooks such as the useRef hook.
- Figure out how to make the current section tab in the navbar animate smoothly when rapidly scrolling (for example scrolling from the contact section to the top of the screen will cause erratic movement of the selected tab)
